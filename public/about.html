    <h4 class="card-title">About the Tool</h4>
    <p class="card-text">   This tool allows people to search for either movie/tv titles or people's names. This is will then give the user a list of titles that are similar to that name. The user will then be able to click on those titles and get a screen with more information about either the movie/tv show or the person. This tool is built on many different applications. The first one is the NodeJS. This tool was used to build the server. This allows us to user various packages that make the development of the server easier. These packages included express, which made the use of get and post requests easiers. The
      next package is the sqlite 3. This allowed us to connect to eh database as well as query the database for the desired information. We also used packages such as body-parser, multiparty, etc. The next tool that we used is angular. This tool was primarily used to populate the pages with the information that we retrieved from the database.
